.Pp
When started normally, freesweep will display a new mission form to query the
following information from the player: height and width of the board, number of
mines as percentage of the size of the board, how to announce alerts (beep,
visual bell, or none), and these preferences will automatically be saved.
.Pp
In normal play, freesweep waits for keystrokes, and then reacts according to
the received value.
The arrow keys move the cursor in the corresponding direction, as limited by
the boundaries of the playing field.
A warning is issued should this occur.
The home, end, page up and page down keys move the cursor to the edges of the
board.
These keys are the standard way to navigate in any part of the game.
.Pp
The
.Em f
key is used to flag or unflag a mine and the
.Em enter or
.Em space
keys will expose the current square for better or worse.
The are also many more key bindings, similar to vi and emacs, available.
Details about these can be found in the help screen with the
.Em p
key during game play.
.Pp
The
.Em p
key during game play displays a tabbed pause screen.
These tabs contain help, best scores, credits, game log and the GPL license.
Pressing the
.Em tab
key switches between each of them.
The
.Em q
key will return back to the game.
.Pp
The game play ends when either all the mines have been flagged correctly or
a mine was exposed.
For large games, a game can be aborted with the
.Em a
key or can be saved for later with the
.Em q
key.
A saved game will be automatically returned to when freesweep is started again.

And I am sure there are many more that could be mentioned here.
.Sh BUGS
Resizing the terminal currently can cause unpredictable behaviour.
.Pp
Mouse support still seems a bit flaky.
It needs some polishing.
